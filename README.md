# JavaScript Foundation Practice

This repository documents my structured journey of strengthening core JavaScript fundamentals before moving to React and the MERN stack.

Focus Areas:
- Objects & Object Literals
- Functions & Arrow Functions
- Scope & Lexical Scope
- this Keyword
- Higher Order Functions
- map / filter / reduce
- DOM Manipulation, Events and mini task
- Async JavaScript (Promises, async/await, fetch)

Purpose:
To build strong problem-solving ability and JavaScript thinking through daily practice, small experiments, and logic-based mini implementations.

Structure:
- basics → syntax & early experiments
- objects → object creation, access, updates
- functions → function logic & mini projects
- dom → DOM manipulation & event practice
- upcoming → scope, async, hof, react prep

Note:
This is a learning and reinforcement repository, not a final UI/UX project repository.
